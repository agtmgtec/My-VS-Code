Issue assignment

The Assignee field is very important in Jira so that each issue has a single designated person responsible for the progress of work and 
serves as a clear point of contact. 
Experiment with assigning issues manually and automatically.


Configure auto-assignment using components.

In what order does Jira process auto-assignment (e.g., Project Default, component Default Assignee, manual selection)?

How can mailed-in issues be auto-assigned?

How can you bypass auto-assignment?

How can you assign issues via workflow post-functions in a company-managed project?

How can you assign issues via workflow rules in a team-managed project?

How can you assign issues via automation rules?

What is the difference between “Assign Issues” and “Assignable User” permissions?

Solution:
--------->

1. Configure Auto-Assignment Using Components
In Jira, components can be used to auto-assign issues to specific users. To set this up:

Navigate to Project Settings:

Go to Jira > Projects.
Select the project where you want to configure auto-assignment.
Click Project settings (bottom-left panel).
Click Components.
Create or Edit a Component:

Click Create component.
Give it a name and description.
In the Component Lead field, select the user who should be assigned issues related to this component.
Set the Default Assignee:
Project default
Component lead
Unassigned
Ensure Default Assignee is Enabled:

Go to Project settings > Details.
Check that "Default Assignee" is set to Project default or Unassigned (if auto-assignment should rely on components).
If you select Unassigned, make sure unassigned issues are enabled in Jira settings > Issues > General Configuration.
How It Works
When an issue is created and a component is selected, Jira assigns the issue based on the Component Lead settings.
If multiple components are assigned, Jira follows the first component added.
2. Jira Auto-Assignment Processing Order
Jira processes issue assignment in the following order:

Manual Selection – If an assignee is manually chosen, that takes precedence.
Component Default Assignee – If the issue has components and they have default assignees, this is applied.
Project Default Assignee – If no manual or component-based assignment occurs, the issue is assigned to the default assignee set at the project level.
Automation Rules or Workflow Post-Functions – If configured, these may override previous assignments.
Unassigned – If no assignment rules are met and unassigned issues are allowed, the issue remains unassigned.
3. How to Auto-Assign Mailed-In Issues
When issues are created via email (Jira Service Management or Jira Core mail handlers), they can be auto-assigned using:

Method 1: Configure a Mail Handler Rule
Go to Jira Settings > System > Incoming Mail.
Configure a mail handler (POP/IMAP).
Under the mail handler settings, set:
Project where issues should be created.
Issue Type to assign relevant workflows.
Default Reporter (if sender is unknown).
Auto-assignment Rules (by component, workflow post-function, or automation rule).
Method 2: Use Jira Automation for Incoming Emails
Go to Project Settings > Automation.
Create a new rule:
Trigger: "Issue created"
Condition: Check if the issue was created via email (Issue fields > Description contains "Email received from").
Action: Assign based on rules (e.g., component, round-robin, etc.).
4. How to Bypass Auto-Assignment
To prevent auto-assignment for specific cases:

Use a Custom Field for Manual Assignment:

Create a custom field (e.g., "Manual Assignee").
If this field is filled, prevent auto-assignment by configuring the workflow or automation rules.
Modify the Workflow to Skip Assignment:

In Jira Workflow, add a condition that prevents automatic assignment for certain users or issue types.
Adjust Automation Rules:

Set a rule: If an issue is manually assigned, stop other automation rules from reassigning.
Use Permissions:

Restrict the "Assignable User" permission so that only select users can be auto-assigned.
5. Assigning Issues via Workflow Post-Functions (Company-Managed Project)
Workflow post-functions allow auto-assignment when transitioning issues.

Steps:
Go to Jira Admin > Issues > Workflows.
Select the workflow used by your project and click Edit.
Choose a transition (e.g., "To Do → In Progress").
Click Post Functions > Add Post Function.
Select Assign to User, Assign to Current User, or Assign to Project Lead.
Set conditions (e.g., assign to a specific user when priority is High).
Publish the workflow.
6. Assigning Issues via Workflow Rules (Team-Managed Project)
For Team-Managed projects, workflows are simpler and rely on rules rather than post-functions.

Steps:
Go to Project settings > Issue types.

Click Edit workflow.

Click a transition (e.g., "To Do → In Progress").

Add a Rule:

Assign the issue to a specific user.
Assign based on reporter.
Assign to last modified user.
Click Save Changes.

7. Assigning Issues via Automation Rules
Jira Automation can dynamically assign issues based on different conditions.

Example 1: Assign Issues Based on Keywords
Go to Project Settings > Automation.
Click Create Rule.
Select Trigger: Issue Created.
Add Condition: If summary contains "urgent".
Add Action: Assign to "John Doe".
Example 2: Round-Robin Assignment
Trigger: Issue Created.
Action: Assign to users in a round-robin fashion.
Use Smart Values to cycle through users.
8. Difference Between "Assign Issues" and "Assignable User" Permissions
Permission	Purpose
Assign Issues	Allows a user to assign issues to others.
Assignable User	Determines if a user can be assigned an issue.
Example Scenarios
If a user has "Assign Issues" permission but NOT "Assignable User," they can assign issues to others but not themselves.
If a user has "Assignable User" but NOT "Assign Issues," they can be assigned issues but cannot assign issues to others.
