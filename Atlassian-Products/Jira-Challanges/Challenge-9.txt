#Challenge-9: [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Administration]
---------------------------------------------------->

Administering and maintaining Jira:
------------------------------------->

Backing up the data of your Jira instance is crucial.

1. What options are included in the backup manager?
2. What data and configurations are included in backups?

1. Backing Up Jira: Understanding the Backup Manager
What Options Are Included in the Backup Manager?
Jira provides two main backup options:

A. Jira Cloud Backup Options
Backup Manager (Admin Panel)
Exports a ZIP file containing issues, configurations, and attachments.

Automated Daily Backups (Cloud)
Atlassian automatically backs up Jira Cloud daily (cannot be manually triggered).

External Backup Solutions
Use third-party apps like Revyz or BackupMyJira for incremental backups.

B. Jira Data Center & Server Backup Options

Jira System Backup
Exports Jira issues and configuration data (XML format).

Database Backups
Admins can manually back up the database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL).

Application-Level Backup (Full Instance)
Includes database, attachments, indexes, and logs.

2. What Data and Configurations Are Included in Backups?

Included in Backup	             Not Included
Issues & Comments	             User passwords (if using external auth)
Custom Fields	                 Marketplace Apps & App Data
Workflows	                     Sprint & Board Configurations
Permissions & Schemes	         Dashboards & Filters (Cloud Backup)
Attachments (if selected)	     Some User Preferences

Best Practice: If using Jira Cloud, supplement backups with a third-party backup tool.

Importing Project Data from Jira:
-------------------------------->
Your company needs to import some project data.

3. What products can you import data from?
4. What are the steps and requirements to import via CSV file?
5. What are the differences between end users importing from CSV versus Jira admins importing via the System menu?

Solution:
---------->

3. What Products Can You Import Data From?
Jira supports importing from:

✅ Another Jira Instance (Cloud → Cloud, Server → Server)
✅ CSV Files (from spreadsheets, external trackers)
✅ Trello (via migration tool)
✅ Asana, Monday.com, ClickUp (via third-party integrations)
✅ Redmine, Bugzilla, GitHub Issues (via CSV or plugins)

4. Importing Data via CSV: Steps and Requirements

1️⃣ Prepare the CSV File
Ensure column headers match Jira field names (Summary, Description, Issue Type).
Use consistent date formats (YYYY/MM/DD).

2️⃣ Access Import Options
Users: Go to Issues > Import Issues from CSV.
Admins: Go to Jira System > External System Import > CSV (allows bulk importing with more control).

3️⃣ Map CSV Fields to Jira Fields
Map Reporter, Assignee, and Custom Fields correctly.

4️⃣ Validate & Import
Jira checks for errors before importing.

5️⃣ Review Imported Issues
Verify data accuracy in the project.

5. Differences:End-Users vs. Jira Admins Importing CSV

Feature	                  End-User Import	                Admin Import (System Menu)
Who Can Use	Any           Jira user	                        Jira Admins only
Scope	                  Single Project	                Multiple Projects
User Permissions	      Users need issue creation rights	Admins bypass permissions
Custom Field Mapping	  Limited	                        Full Control
Bulk Data Changes	      No	                            Yes (e.g., moving issues between projects)

Best Practice: For large data migrations, Jira Admins should handle imports via the System Menu.

Evaluating, Installing, and Managing Atlassian Marketplace Apps
--------------------------------------------------------------->

6. How should you evaluate Marketplace apps?
7. How and where do you install, manage, troubleshoot, and audit apps in Jira?
8. How can users request apps?

Solution:
--------->

6. How to Evaluate Marketplace Apps?

1️⃣ Check Compatibility
Is the app compatible with your Jira version (Cloud vs. Data Center vs. Server)?

2️⃣ Look at Reviews & Support
Are there positive reviews & active support?

3️⃣ Security & Compliance
Check if the app is Atlassian Cloud Fortified for security.

4️⃣ Trial the App
Most apps offer free trials (30 days).

7. How & Where to Install Marketplace Apps?

For Jira Cloud:
Admin Panel > Apps > Find New Apps
Search & install directly from Atlassian Marketplace.

For Jira Data Center & Server:
Download .jar file and upload via Jira Admin > Manage Apps.

Troubleshooting App Issues:
Check logs: Jira Administration > System > Logging & Profiling.
Disable/Re-enable the app.
Check permissions & dependencies.

How to Audit Installed Apps?
Go to Jira Admin > Manage Apps > Audit Logs.
Review who installed/uninstalled apps.

8. How Can Users Request Apps?.
Standard Process for Requesting Apps

A. Submitting a Service Desk Request (Recommended)
Many organizations use Jira Service Management (JSM) or another ITSM tool for app requests.
Users submit a request with details like:
App name (e.g., "ScriptRunner for Jira")
Purpose (why they need the app)
Business justification (how it improves workflows)
Expected usage (team size, required features)

App Name: Tempo Timesheets  
Purpose: Time tracking for project billing  
Justification: Helps track billable hours for client projects  
Expected Usage: Finance & Project Teams (20 users)  

B. Requesting Through Jira Admins or IT Team
Users can email or message the Jira administrator with app details.
Some companies have an internal approval process where the IT or Procurement team evaluates the request.

C. Using a Custom "App Request" Jira Issue Type
Jira admins can create a custom issue type called "App Request" within a Jira project (e.g., IT Helpdesk).
Users create a new issue when they need an app.
The request goes through an approval workflow before installation.

Monitoring, Troubleshooting & Auditing Jira
-------------------------------------------->

9. What monitoring tools are available to Jira administrators?
