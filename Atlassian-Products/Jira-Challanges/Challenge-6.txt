#Challenge-6: [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Administration]
---------------------------------------------------->

Notifications:
-------------->

Different roles in the team require different notifications about issue updates or status changes.

1. What are all the ways in which notifications can be sent from Jira?

2. How do you control which users are notified about which issue changes?

3. In a company-managed project, research using a custom event versus a system event in a workflow post function. When and why might this 
be useful or necessary?

4. In a team-managed project, which events are available and which entries can be added as recipients?

5. How can individual users control which notifications they receive?

6. Which notifications will users always receive regardless of their personal settings?

7. Can Jira administrators send an email to users?

Solution:
---------->

1. What are all the ways in which notifications can be sent from Jira?
Jira provides multiple methods to send notifications about issue updates:

Email Notifications:
Sent via SMTP based on notification schemes or automation rules.
Users receive emails when they are added as watchers, assignees, reporters, or participants.

Jira In-App Notifications:
Alerts appear in the notification bell icon inside Jira.
Users can configure notification preferences.

Slack or Microsoft Teams Notifications (via Atlassian Marketplace Apps or Automation Rules)
Notifications can be sent to Slack channels or MS Teams using integrations.
Commonly used for agile standups, issue assignments, and updates.

Webhook Notifications
Jira can send JSON payloads to external URLs (e.g., CI/CD tools, monitoring dashboards).
Used in automation and integrations.

Mobile Push Notifications
Jira Mobile App sends real-time notifications for assigned issues and mentions.

Jira Service Management (JSM) Customer Notifications
Customers receive updates via email notifications when their requests are updated.

Jira Automation Notifications
Custom notifications triggered via Jira Automation rules.
Can send messages via email, Slack, Teams, or webhooks.

2. How do you control which users are notified about which issue changes?

Notification Schemes (Company-Managed Projects)
Jira Admins configure Notification Schemes that define which events trigger notifications.
Users assigned to specific roles, groups, or issue fields (e.g., Assignee, Reporter, Watchers) receive notifications.

Issue-Level Notifications
Users can watch issues to receive notifications.
Users mentioned in comments (@mention) get notifications.

Custom Automation Rules:
Jira Automation allows configuring rules to notify specific users or groups when an issue changes.

Jira Service Management (JSM) Customer Notifications
Admins can configure customer notifications for status updates, SLA breaches, approvals, etc..
Project Roles & Groups
Notifications can be set based on project roles (e.g., Developers, Testers, Managers).
Example: Managers receive notifications on high-priority issues only.

3. Using a Custom Event vs. a System Event in a Workflow Post Function (Company-Managed Projects)

System Events
Predefined in Jira (e.g., Issue Created, Issue Updated, Issue Resolved).
Used in default notification schemes.

Custom Events
Admins can create custom events in Jira Administration > System > Events.
Used in workflows when you need specific notifications for custom status transitions.

When and Why to Use a Custom Event?
For Role-Specific Notifications: Notify only QA Team when an issue enters “Ready for Testing.”
For External Integrations: Send webhooks only for certain transitions.
For Granular Control: Avoid unnecessary emails to users not involved in a workflow stage.

Example Use Case
A company wants only Release Managers to be notified when an issue reaches the "Ready for Release" stage.

Solution: Create a custom event “Ready for Release” and modify the notification scheme to alert only Release Managers.

4. Notifications in Team-Managed Projects (Jira Work Management & Jira Software Next-Gen)
Unlike Company-Managed Projects, Team-Managed Projects have simplified notification settings.

Available Events
Issue Created
Issue Updated
Issue Assigned
Issue Transitioned
Comment Added

Who Can Receive Notifications?
Reporter
Assignee
Mentioned Users
Watchers
Project Administrator

Limitations:
Cannot customize notification schemes like in company-managed projects.
No support for custom events.

5. How Can Individual Users Control Which Notifications They Receive?
Users can adjust their notification preferences in:

Personal Email Notifications
Go to Profile > Personal Settings.

Options include:
Receive notifications immediately, in batches, or never.
Disable own issue updates (avoid self-notifications).

Jira In-App Notifications
Users can configure browser notifications for assigned or watched issues.

Jira Mobile Notifications
Enable or disable push notifications for new issues or mentions.

Notification Muting
Users can mute specific Jira projects to reduce noise.

6. Which Notifications Will Users Always Receive Regardless of Personal Settings?

Some notifications override user preferences:

@mentions in Comments or Issue Descriptions → Always receive a notification.
Issue Assignments → The new assignee always receives a notification.
Customer Notifications in Jira Service Management (JSM) → Customers receive status updates based on request type settings.
Admin-Triggered Notifications (e.g., password reset emails, system alerts).

7. Can Jira Administrators Send an Email to Users?

Yes, Jira Admins Can Send Emails via:

1. Bulk Email (Admin Panel)
Go to Jira Administration > System > Outgoing Mail > Send Email.
Can send an announcement to specific groups or all users.

2. Jira Automation
Set up an automation rule to send custom emails to a specific group.

3. Issue Notifications
Admins can modify notification schemes to send additional email alerts.

4. Webhooks + Email API
Use third-party email services (e.g., SendGrid, Outlook, Gmail API) to trigger emails outside Jira.

5. Jira Service Management (JSM) Customer Emails
Admins can manually notify customers via Jira Service Desk portal.
