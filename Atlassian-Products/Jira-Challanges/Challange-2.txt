#Challange 2:
---------------------->
Controlling security 
--------------------



Now that external customers have access to your Jira instance, you need to ensure that security is tightly controlled. 

1. What levels of security are available within Jira? 
Product Level - This controls the access to entire Jira Product, access to entire Jira instance which is controlled by Jira Org Admins, will grant right access to users and groups
Project Level (Role) - Based on the Project Role the External actors would only be granted access to their project only with the principle of "need to know basis" 
Issue Level Security - Only authorized level users would be able to do the activities, required.

2. What configurations grant access to public issue tracker projects?
Grant access to Public ? 

3. How can you hide specific issues from external users?  
Issue Security - Create a Issue security, with certain clearence level, such that issues which only have proper clearence would only be visible to certain users (eg: Externals)

4. Must you add specific users or groups only? Or are more dynamic entries available?
For Dynamic assignment there are many:
Application based access: A group which has access to Jira-Software can be assigned to any logged in users such that they can get the required access,
Jira Automation: Automation can be set up such that if there is any particaular issue created it has to be assigned to respective group.
Dynamic User Picker: We can use Scriptrunner to create automations to add in users mentioned.

5. Can you hide issue comments?
Yes, Only through Global Configurations, where comments can be made to be visible only fro project roles ie: comments visibilities.

6. What cannot be hidden on an issue?
(System Fields) Epic colour, Epic Link, Epic Name, Design, Development, Category, Approvals, Issue type, goals, Major Incident, Open form etc

7. Which permissions control the editing of certain system fields?
Cannot edit system fields

8. How can you ensure that external users cannot edit certain fields inline but internal users can?
We can assign certain editable roles to only certain users and then assign the right project roles accordingly.

9. What permissions do external users need to create dashboards and filters?
They require Share Dashboards and filters permission.

10. Can you ensure that dashboards and filters are shared with internal users only?
Yes, it can be done such that any new filters / dashboards created would be shared with only certain project role members.

11. Can you limit who can view and select users or groups from the user pickers?
Yes, we can create a custom field with user picker (single /multiple) and use issue security to create levels such that if any externals only with that security level clearance can access / see those issues.

12. Can you control who can execute bulk operations?
No, Only Jira admins can move / execute bulk operations on Jira 

13. Is there a difference in configuring access and security settings between company-managed and team-managed projects?
Yes, the Company managed projects has more flexibitlity compared to team managed projects since they have schemas available to configure access / permission based on the project requirement.

-------------------------------------------------------------

1Ô∏è‚É£ What levels of security are available within Jira?
Jira provides multiple security levels to control access:

Global Permissions: Control overall Jira access (e.g., who can create projects).
Project Permissions: Define what users/groups can do within a project (e.g., browse, edit, transition issues).
Issue Security Schemes: Restrict access to specific issues within a project.
Field Security (via Apps): Control visibility of certain fields.
Comment Visibility: Restrict who can view specific comments.

2Ô∏è‚É£ What configurations grant access to public issue tracker projects?
To make a Jira project public, you need to:

Go to Project Settings > Permissions.
Edit the Permission Scheme:
Add Anyone to Browse Projects (allows public viewing).
Add Anyone to Create Issues (if external users should submit issues).
Adjust Issue Security (Optional):
Use Issue Security Schemes to restrict certain issues from public view.
Allow anonymous access in Global Permissions (Settings > System > Global Permissions).

3Ô∏è‚É£ How can you hide specific issues from external users?
Use Issue Security Schemes:

Assign a security level to issues (e.g., "Internal Only").
Define who can see issues based on roles, groups, or users.
Users without the required security level cannot see the issue even if they have project access.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Must you add specific users or groups only? Or are more dynamic entries available?
You can add specific users or groups.
Dynamic options available:
Project Roles (e.g., "Developers", "QA Team").
SCIM Groups (Atlassian Access) for auto-syncing groups from Identity Providers (Okta, Azure AD).
Automation Rules to assign access based on issue fields or reporter details.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Can you hide issue comments?
‚úÖ Yes! You can restrict comment visibility by:

Setting "Viewable by" when adding a comment (e.g., restrict to Developers or Admins).
Using Issue Security Schemes to hide comments along with the issue.
Some marketplace apps (like Field Security Plugin) allow per-user comment restrictions.

6Ô∏è‚É£ What cannot be hidden on an issue?
Certain fields in Jira cannot be hidden:

Issue Summary
Issue Key
Issue Type
Project Name
Issue Status (unless the issue itself is hidden using security schemes)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Which permissions control the editing of certain system fields?
Edit Issues: Allows general issue editing.
Schedule Issues: Controls editing of the Due Date field.
Assign Issues: Controls changes to the Assignee field.
Set Issue Security: Controls who can change an issue‚Äôs security level.
Link Issues: Controls who can create or remove issue links.

8Ô∏è‚É£ How can you ensure that external users cannot edit certain fields inline but internal users can?
Use Workflow Properties:
Restrict fields based on issue status.
Field Configuration Schemes:
Make fields read-only for certain users.
Issue Security Schemes:
Restrict external users from viewing or editing issues entirely.
Marketplace Apps (e.g., Field Security Plugin):
Control field access dynamically per user/group.

9Ô∏è‚É£ What permissions do external users need to create dashboards and filters?
Create Shared Objects: Allows users to create and share filters/dashboards.
Manage Shared Dashboards: Controls who can edit shared dashboards.
Global Permissions > Create Filters and Dashboards: External users need this permission to create them.

üîü Can you ensure that dashboards and filters are shared with internal users only?
‚úÖ Yes!

Restrict filter/dashboard sharing to specific groups (e.g., "Internal Users").
Use Global Permissions to limit who can share dashboards.
Disable Public Sharing (Jira Admin > System > General Configuration).

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Can you limit who can view and select users or groups from the user pickers?
‚úÖ Yes!

Global Permission: Browse Users controls who can search for users.
Group Membership Restrictions prevent external users from seeing certain groups.
Field Configuration: Hide user-picker fields from specific roles/groups.

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Can you control who can execute bulk operations?
‚úÖ Yes!

The Bulk Change permission in Global Permissions controls who can:
Bulk edit
Bulk delete
Bulk transition issues

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Is there a difference in configuring access and security settings between company-managed and team-managed projects?
‚úÖ Yes, major differences exist!

Feature	                        Company-Managed	                         Team-Managed
Permissions	            Highly customizable (Permission Schemes)	Basic project permissions
Issue Security	        Supports Issue Security Schemes	            ‚ùå Not available
Custom Roles	        Supports Custom Roles & Groups	            ‚ùå Limited roles (Admin, Member, Viewer)
Global Settings	        Jira Admins control settings	            Each project admin controls settings
Automation	            Advanced rules available	                Limited to project scope
üîπ Company-managed projects offer better control over security and permissions.
üîπ Team-managed projects are simpler but less customizable.
