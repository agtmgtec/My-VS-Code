1. How Do the Steps Differ to Modify a Workflow in a Company-Managed vs. Team-Managed Project?
Jira offers two types of projects:

✅ Company-Managed Projects (CMP) – More customizable, managed by Jira admins.
✅ Team-Managed Projects (TMP) – Simpler, self-managed by project admins.

Feature	                                         Company-Managed Project	                       Team-Managed Project
Who Can Edit Workflows?	                         Jira Admins	                                      Project Admins
Where to Edit?	                                 Jira Settings > Issues > Workflows	                  Project Settings > Issue Types
Editing Complexity	                             Advanced (Post-functions, Validators, Conditions)	  Simplified Drag & Drop [Some Rules Exhist]
Reusable Workflows?	                             Yes, shared across multiple projects	              No, unique per project

Steps to Modify a Workflow:

🔷 Company-Managed Project (CMP)

Go to Jira Admin → Issues → Workflows.
Select the workflow and click Edit (if used by multiple projects, create a draft).
Modify transitions, add conditions, validators, or post-functions.
Publish the changes.

🔷 Team-Managed Project (TMP)

Go to the Project → Project Settings → Issue Types.
Click on the workflow Edit Workflow (drag & drop interface).
Add or modify statuses and rules.
Save changes.

2. What Types of Transitions Exist in Both Types of Workflows?
Transitions define how an issue moves from one status to another.

Transition Type	Description:

One-Way (Basic)	Move from Status A → Status B
Two-Way (Reversible):	Status A ↔ Status B (e.g., “Reopen” can go back to "In Progress")
Global Transitions:	 Any status can transition to a specific status (e.g., “Cancel” to “Done” from anywhere)
Loopback Transitions:	Moves back to the same status (e.g., Approval required)

🔹 Team-Managed Workflows support simpler transitions without conditions or validators.
🔹 Company-Managed Workflows support validators, conditions, post-functions, and scripting.

3. How Are Notifications Tied to Workflows in Company-Managed Projects?
In CMP, notifications are managed by the Notification Scheme and triggered during workflow transitions.

Steps to Configure Notifications:
Go to Jira Settings → Issues → Notification Schemes.
Find the scheme assigned to the project and Edit it.
Add or modify notifications for:
Issue Created
Issue Updated
Issue Assigned
Issue Resolved
Issue Closed

🔹 You can also trigger custom notifications using post-functions or automation rules.

4. What Rules Can You Add to a Team-Managed Workflow?
In a Team-Managed Workflow, you can add Rules to transitions.

Rule Type	Function
 1. Restrict Transition: Restrictbased on status of subtask, Restrict to when a field has a specific Value, Restrict who can move the issue, Restrict
    when a issue has been through a specific status, Restrict users who have previously updated an issue status.
 2. Validate Details: Validate a Field, Validate that an issue has been through a specfic status, Validate that parent issues are in a specfic status,
    Validate that the people has specfic permission.
 3. Perform actions: Assignan issue, Copy the Value of one field to another, Update an issue field.
 
🔹 These rules help enforce structured workflows without requiring admin intervention.

5. Impact of Changing a Status Name in a Company-Managed Project?

🔴 Changing a status name affects all workflows that use it.

Issues in that status are automatically updated to reflect the new name.
Dashboard reports, filters, and JQL queries using status = "Old Name" will break.
Status mappings in integrations (Jira Service Management, automation rules) might stop working.

✅ Solution: Update all filters, dashboards, and integrations to use the new status name.

6. Impact of Changing a Status Name in a Team-Managed Project
🔹 Since workflows are not shared, changing a status name affects only that project.
🔹 Filters and automation rules within the project might need updates, but other projects remain unaffected.

7. What Else Should You Update After Making Changes to a Workflow?

After modifying a workflow:

Update Filters & Dashboards – Update queries that reference statuses.
Modify Automation Rules – Ensure they still apply correctly.
Adjust Reports – Check if reports need updates due to status changes.
Notify Teams – Inform users about new workflows.
Check Permission Schemes – Ensure the right users can transition issues.

8. When to Use a Post-Function vs. Automation Rule in Company-Managed Projects?

Feature	                            Post-Function (Workflow)	                             Automation Rule
Executes during transitions?	            Yes	                                             Yes or after transitions
Requires workflow changes?	                Yes	                                             No
Triggers external actions?	                No	                                             Yes (e.g., Slack notifications, email alerts)
Best for	                        Assigning issues, updating fields, adding comments	     Sending notifications, cross-project actions, SLA rules

🔹 Post-Functions are better for field updates, assignments, and internal workflow logic.
🔹 Automation Rules are better for cross-project triggers and notifications.

9. What Are the Parts of an Automation Rule?
Automation rules have three main parts:

Trigger – The event that starts the rule (e.g., "Issue Created").
Conditions – Checks if the rule should proceed (e.g., "Priority = High").
Action – What happens if conditions are met (e.g., "Assign to John").

🔹 Optional: Add a Branch Rule for related issues (e.g., update linked issues).

10. Where Can You See What Automation Rules Are Running in a Project?
To check automation rules:

Go to Project Settings → Automation.
Click Audit Log to see:

Successful rule executions.
Failed rules with error details.
Skipped rules (when conditions aren't met).

11. How Can You Change the Automation Rule Actor and Why?
By default, automation rules run as the user who created them or the Automation for Jira user.

Steps to Change the Rule Actor:

Go to Project Settings > Automation.
Open the rule and click Rule Details.

Change the Actor to:
A specific user (if actions should be recorded under their name).

Automation for Jira (if you don’t want a personal user associated).

Why Change It?
✔ Prevent automation failures due to user permission issues.
✔ Ensure consistency in issue tracking.
✔ Use a system user (Automation for Jira) to keep rules working even if the creator leaves.
