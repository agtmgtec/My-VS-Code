#Challenge-1: [ACP-120 Jira Cloud Administration]
---------------------------------------------------->

Collaborating with external users
---------------------------------->

So far, your Jira instance has only been used by internal users for internal purposes. Now the instance should be partially opened up to 
external customers.  These are the question you need to be asking yourself when you collaborate with external users. 

External customers

1. How can you grant external customers read-only access to only a few projects? Later, you also want to allow external customers 
to work on issues. What needs to be updated?

Jira issues

2. Can you enable them to submit issues to Jira without having user accounts or product access. What are the different methods for them to do so?

Solution:
------------>

1. External Customers: Granting Read-Only Access to Specific Projects

üîπ Option 1: Use Jira Service Management (JSM) for External Users
Best for: External customer support, IT helpdesk, and ticketing.

JSM allows external customers to view and create issues via a customer portal without needing full Jira access.
Customers do not count towards your Jira license.
Steps:

Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Customer Permissions.
Set "Who can raise requests?" to:
‚úî Anyone can email the helpdesk or access the portal (public).
‚úî Only customers added by agents (controlled access).
Set "Who can view requests?" to:
‚úî "Customers can view their own requests" (default).
‚úî "Customers can view and comment on requests from their organization."

üîπ Option 2: Use Permission Schemes in Jira Software (for Non-Service Projects)
Best for: External partners working on specific software projects.

Create a Group for External Users

Go to Jira Admin > User Management > Groups.
Create a new group (e.g., external-customers).
Add external users to this group.
Modify the Project‚Äôs Permission Scheme

Go to Jira Admin > Issues > Permission Schemes.
Create/Edit a permission scheme to restrict access:
Browse Projects ‚Üí external-customers (read-only).
View Issues ‚Üí external-customers.
Comment on Issues (if needed) ‚Üí external-customers.
Assign this permission scheme to the relevant project.
Enable Issue-Level Security (Optional)

Go to Project Settings > Issue Security.
Create a new security scheme to ensure external users only see certain issues.
‚úÖ Now, external users have read-only access to specific projects.

2. Allowing External Users to Work on Issues
If you want external users to create and update issues, update the permission scheme:

Grant external-customers permission for:
Create Issues
Edit Issues
Add Comments
Transition Issues (if required)
üí° Tip: Use Issue Security Schemes to limit what they can see within the project.

3. Enabling External Users to Submit Issues Without Accounts
If external users need to submit issues without Jira accounts, you can use one of these methods:

üîπ Option 1: Enable Jira Service Management (Best for Support Requests)
JSM allows users to submit tickets via:

Email (e.g., support@yourcompany.com).
Customer Portal (external-facing web interface).
Embedded Widgets on your website.
Steps to enable email submission:

Go to Project Settings > Email Requests.
Link an email address (e.g., support@yourcompany.com).
Configure automation rules to categorize or auto-assign issues.

üîπ Option 2: Use Anonymous Access in Jira Software (Limited Use)
Jira Software and Core allow anonymous issue creation if enabled.

Steps:

Go to Jira Admin > System > General Configuration.
Enable Public Sign-Up (if needed).
Adjust project permissions:
Create Issues ‚Üí Anyone (Public).
Browse Projects ‚Üí Anonymous Users (if read-only access is needed).
‚ùó Risk: Any external user can create issues, so spam protection is needed.

üîπ Option 3: Create a Public Web Form (Forms to Jira Integration)
Use Google Forms, Typeform, or a Custom Web Form.
Configure the form to send submissions via email to a Jira-managed inbox.
Jira can automatically create issues via its Mail Handler.

Steps:

Set up a Google Form with issue fields (e.g., Title, Description, Priority).
Use an email handler to process responses into Jira issues.
Summary of External User Collaboration Methods
Requirement	Best Approach
Read-only access to select projects	Permission Schemes (Jira Software)
Submit issues via email	Jira Service Management Email Handler
Submit issues via a portal	Jira Service Management Portal
Submit issues without an account	Public Form + Email Handler
External users working on issues	Permission Updates + Issue Security
